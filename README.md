# HashTable in C
Just to test my current C programming chopsticks :-)

## Description
This is a working implementation of a HashTable or Hashmap or Associative Arrays made in the good ... old C programming language. <br>
This implementation, that I made, isn't optimized for speed, I just wanted to put a lot of stuff in it. <br>
Like I said, just to test my current chopsticks ... they are fine hehehe <br>
